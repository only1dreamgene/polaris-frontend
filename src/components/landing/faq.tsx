    a: 'Polaris is a prediction market — you take a position on a real-world price outcome, priced by supply and demand, not a house edge. That said, you can lose your full stake on the losing side, same as any market. Trade with money you can afford to lose.',
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if the price oracle goes down?",
    a: "Settlement never depends on any single party staying online. If a market can't be settled by its expiry, anyone can permissionlessly trigger a full refund after a grace period — funds are never stuck waiting on us.",
  },
  {
    q: 'Do I need to already own crypto?',
    a: "No wallet, no seed phrase, and no XLM required just to sign in — a passkey (Face ID, Touch ID, or a hardware key) creates a secure passkey account for you. You'll need a small amount of XLM to actually trade.",
  },
  {
    q: 'Is my money safe?',
    a: 'Every position is fully collateralized — funds only ever move automatically, based on the market’s own rules, never through an admin key. The contracts are open source; see the docs for the full trust model and known limitations.',
